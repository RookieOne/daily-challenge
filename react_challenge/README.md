# Counter JavaScript test

## Problem
  Develop an app using JavaScript and ReactJS that allows you to track multiple counter totals in the browser.

  The app should consist of the following. A total counter, the ability to add a counter and the ability to increment and decrement that counter. (See layout for example UI).

## Wallaby

In case you are wondering, Wallaby is a test runner / code coverage tool that (when it works) is awesome. [https://wallabyjs.com/](https://wallabyjs.com/)

It is pretty finicky though so ends up not being awesome all the time. :P
